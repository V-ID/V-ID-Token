VIDT Datalink (VIDT)

This is the complete source code of the VIDT Datalink smart contract, issued for saving data in the Ethereum blockchain and for processing micro payments that require KYC by wallet address.

The VIDT Datalink token is able to make use of all 3 tiers of data processing in this blockchain, using the transaction, state en receipt tries.

Version 36 is published at https://etherscan.io/token/0x445f51299ef3307dbd75036dd896565f5b4bf7a5 and available here as VIDT OLD.sol. 
The VIDT-commented OLD.sol is the exact same version, supplemented with explanatory comments.
