V-ID Blockchain Validation Token (VIDT)

This is the complete source code of the V-ID token smart contract, issued for saving data in the Ethereum blockchain and for processing micro payments that require KYC by wallet address.

The V-ID token is able to make use of all 3 tiers of data processing in this blockchain, using the transaction, state en receipt tries.

Version 36 is published at https://etherscan.io/token/0x445f51299ef3307dbd75036dd896565f5b4bf7a5 and available here as VIDT OLD.sol. 
The VIDT-commented OLD.sol is the exact same version, supplemented with explanatory comments.

*UPDATE October 4th 2020*

In response to the KuCoin security incident, a new smart contract was deployed. The old contract has been paused and can no longer be used.
The ONLY VALID Ethereum smart contract is published at https://etherscan.io/token/0xfeF4185594457050cC9c23980d301908FE057Bb1 and available here as VIDT.sol

More information about V-ID is available at https://about.v-id.org, the token ICO website is https://token.v-id.org.

Our validation service is live since August 2018 and in continuous beta as we extend functionalities. 

Verification is live at https://www.v-id.org since December 2018.

*IMPORTANT NOTES*

- Both old and new contract addresses are NOT crowdsale addresses and never were.
- As our smart contract is on the blockchain since 18-08-2018, this repository is not expected to be updated.
- V-ID sourcecode is proprietary property and will not be made public. 
- V-ID leases an unrestricted license to deploy the WIDIDI M16 platform.
